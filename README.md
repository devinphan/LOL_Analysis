League of Legends is one of the world's most popular esports, with professional matches watched by millions globally and featuring multi-million dollar prize pools. Understanding what leads to victory in these high-stakes competitions is not just a matter of gaming interest—it's a serious analytical challenge with implications for team strategy, player development, and even sports betting markets.
